# TicTacToeKotlin
TicTacToe is something that every noob programmer would make. So I also made one. Why? Because of I'm noob right. Wrong! I am the best programmer in the world. The world revolves around me. I didn't make this tictactoe game. The game made me. Haha aside from the jokes (I know they ain't funny), this is a simple commandline TicTacToe game which can be played using keyboard commands. Yeah you can't use mouse on the command line. You gotta use the good ol' keyboard. When giving commands, first you have to type the letter of the relevent column and then the number of the relevent row. (For example, B2 for the middle square) then you can make a cross on the board. Each board will be printed on the command line
This should be the most elegant code I have ever wrote so far. Even though the code explains itself, I have added my own comments to the code for more more understanding.
You are free to use my code anywhere as it is open source.
